    %p Funding on URUUT is made in exchange for payment in kind: goods, services, special benefits or other perks. Offer something valuable for the funds. No T-shirts and shout-outs for $100.

    %p Perks could include a house account for your investors, discounted goods or services, special lessons or workshops, or a private party just for seeders. Be creative!
    %p The most common amounts invested are between $25-$100. We suggest you offer some good value perks at a low cost for casual investors who might not know your organization well, and a handful of high end rewards that are likely to appeal to your inner circle or die-hard fans.
    %p If youâ€™re having a hard time thinking about some great perks, check out our Project Guide or just let us know and we can help you.
