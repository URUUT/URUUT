                %b Fundraising -
                Uruut’s fundraising platform has been called
                beautiful and enjoyable to use. Incorporating best practices in online giving,
                crowdfunding and social interaction, it turns donating to a cause into an
                enjoyable, social and interactive experience. We are also the only platform built to
                help nonproﬁts attract donors from not only individuals but businesses and
                foundations as well.

                %b Donor Relationship Management -
                Let’s face it at the end of the day it’s about your
                donor. The more you know about them and the easier it is to reach them then the
                greater chance for long term success. Whether its our tools or through our
                partnership program Uruut aims to offer the most ﬂexible, powerful donor
                management solutions at an affordable price.
