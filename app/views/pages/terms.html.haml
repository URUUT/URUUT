    %span.bold About URUUT - 
    URUUT provides a platform on this Website for certain users (“Project Sponsors“) to create and manage campaigns to fund community projects (“Projects”) by soliciting contributions (“Contributions”) from this Website’s users. URUUT also offers consulting and management services to Project Sponsors (“URUUT Services”).
  %p 
    %span.bold Sponsoring a Project – 
    Project Sponsors must provide a description of their Project (a “Project Description”) and complete reports as requested by URUUT from time to time (“Project Reports” and, together with any Project Descriptions, “Project Materials”). By sponsoring a Project, the Project Sponsor is publicly offering to, if the   Project’s stated contribution goal is reached:
  %ul
    %li accept Contributions (after deducting URUUT’s and its payment processor’s fees) on behalf of a Project from this Website’s users in compliance with these Terms of Use and any Project Materials;
    %li use Contributions solely as permitted by these Terms of Use and as described in any Project Materials;
    %li permit business, foundations, and other third-parties to sponsor the Project as “Business/Foundation Sponsors,” subject to the applicable Project Sponsor's review and acceptance of such sponsorship;
    %li accept “Business/Foundation Contributions” from such permitted Business/Foundation Sponsors in compliance with these Terms of Use, any Project Materials and applicable law;
    %li allow such permitted Business/Foundation Sponsors to publicize their Business/Foundation Contribution and status as a Business/Foundation Sponsor of the Project;
    %li use good faith efforts to provide any goods or services offered to solicit Contributions (“Perquisites”) in the manner and at the times described in the Project Materials; and

  %ul
    %li categorized budgets and expenditures
    %li status of project tasks
    %li photo and video updates of the project (at least 1 of photo or video per Project Report)
  %p Project Sponsors further agree to provide such additional items in Project Reports or such additional Project Reports as URUUT may reasonably request.
  %p Contributions: In addition, by sponsoring a Project, each Project Sponsor agrees with URUUT that it will not take any action in reliance on receiving any amount of Contributions until it actually receives such Contributions. Each Project Sponsor acknowledges that URUUT is not responsible for a project’s success or failure reaching its contribution goal. Each Project Sponsor further acknowledges that URUUT may be unable to collect Contributions for many reasons, including credit card limits, freezes, holds and chargebacks, even if such failure to collect Contributions causes the Project Sponsor to fail to meet its contribution goal or receive proceeds in an amount less than the contribution goal.
  %p Exclusivity: Each Project Sponsor further agrees that, until the expiration of any applicable contribution deadline described in the Project Materials, it will not solicit or take receipt of donations or contributions for the Project or any similar Project through any non-URUUT website that permits members of the public to make contributions. The Project Sponsor may link to its Projects from its own website.
  %p 
    %span.bold Contributing to a Project – 
    When users of this Website chose to contribute to a Project, they accept the offer described above and form a binding contract with the Project Sponsor (such contributing users, “Contributors”). By contributing to a Project, each Contributor is agreeing with URUUT and the Project Sponsor to:
  %ul
    %li provide URUUT (or its payment processor) with such Contributor's credit card billing information and authorize URUUT to place a hold on such Contributor’s credit card for the amount of such Contribution and/or charge the amount of such Contributor's Contribution if the Project’s stated contribution goal is reached;
    %li permit URUUT to provide the Contribution to the Project Sponsor after deducting any fees of URUUT and/or its payment processor;
    %li have available a sufficient balance or credit amount to cover the Contribution; and
    %li provide to URUUT and permit URUUT to share with the Project Sponsor any Contributor information described in the Project Materials.
  %p 
    %span.bold  Business/Foundation Sponsorship – 
    By choosing to become a Business/Foundation Sponsor of a Project, such Business/Foundation Sponsor is offering to the Project Sponsor and URUUT to, if the Project Sponsor accepts your proposed Business/Foundation Sponsorship and any additional sponsorship terms set forth in the Project Materials or in a separate sponsorship agreement between the Project Sponsor and the proposed Business/Foundation Sponsor:

    %li provide and permit the use of such Business/Foundation Sponsor's corporate name and logo in connection with URUUT and the Project Sponsor’s promotion of the Project;
    %li permit URUUT and the Project Sponsor to identify such Business/Foundation Sponsor as a Business/Foundation Sponsor of the Project; and
