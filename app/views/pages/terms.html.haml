    %span.bold About URUUT - 
    URUUT provides a platform on this Website for certain users (“Project Sponsors”) to create and manage campaigns to fund community projects (“Projects”) by soliciting contributions as more fully described herein below (“Contributions”) from this Website’s users. URUUT also offers consulting and management services to Project Sponsors (“URUUT Services”).
  %p 
    %span.bold Sponsoring a Project – 
    Project Sponsors must provide a description of their Project (a “Project Description”) and complete reports as requested by URUUT from time to time (“Project Reports” and, together with any Project Descriptions, “Project Materials”). By sponsoring a Project, the Project Sponsor is publicly offering to, if the Project’s stated contribution goal is reached:
  %ul
    %li accept Contributions (after Project Sponsor deducts URUUT’s fees and URUUT's third party payment processor’s fees) on behalf of a Project from this Website’s users in compliance with these Terms of Use and any Project Materials;
    %li use Contributions solely as permitted by these Terms of Use and as described in any Project Materials;
    %li permit business, foundations, and other third-parties to sponsor the Project as “Business/Foundation Sponsors,” subject to the applicable Project Sponsor's review and acceptance of such sponsorship;
    %li accept “Business/Foundation Contributions” from such permitted Business/Foundation Sponsors in compliance with these Terms of Use, any Project Materials and applicable law;
    %li allow such permitted Business/Foundation Sponsors to publicize their Business/Foundation Contribution and status as a Business/Foundation Sponsor of the Project;
    %li use good faith efforts to provide any goods or services offered to solicit Contributions (“Perquisites”) in the manner and at the times described in the Project Materials; and
    %li timely submit required Project Reports to URUUT.
  %p Minimum Project Reports: Project Sponsors must provide at least biweekly Project Reports including:
  %ul
    %li categorized budgets and expenditures
    %li status of project tasks
    %li photo and video updates of the project (at least 1 of photo or video per Project Report)
  %p Project Sponsors further agree to provide such additional items in Project Reports or such additional Project Reports as URUUT may reasonably request.
  %p Contributions: Contributions made to the Project Sponsor may be in the form of credit card payments through the use of URUUT's third party payment processors' web portal ("Payment Portal") which is accessible through this Website. Contributions other than through the Payment Portal may be in any other form of direct payment to the Project Sponsor. URUUT will not have custody or control of any form of Contributions. Contributions through the Payment Portal or direct payment Contributions pledged to the Project Sponsor in advance of Project completion will be catalogued and tracked for the Project Sponsor through the use of the URUUT Services.  Contributions other than payments through the Payment Portal may be received directly by the Project Sponsor but not until the Project’s completion goal is complete. Once complete, the Project Sponsor will be required to remit a portion of the Contribution as payment for fees incurred by the utilization of the URUUT Services. In addition, by sponsoring a Project, each Project Sponsor agrees with URUUT that it will not take any action in reliance on receiving any amount of Contributions until it actually receives such Contributions. Each Project Sponsor acknowledges that URUUT is not responsible for a project’s success or failure reaching its contribution goal. Each Project Sponsor acknowledges that Project Sponsor may be unable to collect all pledged Contributions for reasons, including but not limited to credit card limits, freezes, holds and chargebacks, or insufficient funds. Project Sponsor understands and acknowledges that failure to collect Contributions may cause the Project Sponsor to fail to meet is contribution goal or receive proceeds in an amount less than the contribution goal.
  %p Exclusivity: Each Project Sponsor further agrees that, until the expiration of any applicable contribution deadline described in the Project Materials, it will not solicit or take receipt of donations or contributions for the Project or any similar Project through any non-URUUT website that permits members of the public to make contributions through the use of a similarly configured Payment Portal or offers similar consulting services. The Project Sponsor may link to its Projects from its own website.
  %p 
    %span.bold Contributing to a Project – 
    When users of this Website chose to contribute to a Project, they accept the offer described above and form a binding contract with the Project Sponsor (such contributing users, “Contributors”). By contributing to a Project, each Contributor is agreeing with URUUT and the Project Sponsor to:
  %ul
    %li provide URUUT and the Project Sponsor through use of the Payment Portal with such Contributor's credit card billing information and authorize the Project Sponsorto place a hold on such Contributor’s credit card for the amount of such Contribution and/or charge the amount of such Contributor's Contribution if the Project’s stated contribution goal is reached;
    %li permit Project Sponsor to remit a portion of the Contribution of fees to URUUT and URUUT's third party payment processor ;
    %li have available a sufficient checking account balance or credit card balance in amounts sufficient cover the Contribution; and
    %li provide to URUUT and permit URUUT to share with the Project Sponsor any Contributor information described in the Project Materials.
  %p

    %li permit URUUT and the Project Sponsor to identify such Business/Foundation Sponsor as a Business/Foundation Sponsor of the Project; and
    %li pay the requested Business/Foundation Contribution to the Project Sponsor in accordance with the terms set forth above for payment of Contributions.
