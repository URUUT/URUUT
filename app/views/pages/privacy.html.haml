    %i Actively Submitted Data:
    When you create an account, sponsor a project, contribute to a project, agree to provide

    to allow us to respond to your inquiry, you will receive a notice advising you of this. In each such instance, you will
    know what personal information we collect through the Website, because you actively submit it.

  %p

We and our analytics partners use technology that many other websites employ, including, without limitation, “cookies” (small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive), to collect such information.

    like transaction in which Nonprofit Xchange is not the survivor, (6) in the case of your name, e-mail address and contribution
    amount to project sponsors to whom you have made a contribution and whose funding goal has been reached and
    any business/foundation sponsors of such projects or (6) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law. Also, we
    reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form (such as
    statistics and survey results that do not identify you individually by name).
