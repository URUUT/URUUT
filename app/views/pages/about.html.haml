		%h2 Our Story
		
		%p The seed for Uruut was planted over ten years ago. Two life long friends that grew up together in New York heard reports a certain ultra high net worth individual was stepping in to fund key municipal & community projects in New York City. These were projects key to NYC but unfortunately they weren't being funded.

		%p From that day forward, these two friends sought a way to accomplish the same goal, in spite of either one of them coming anywhere close to being considered high net worth. After more than ten years following the first conversation, and after many twists and turns and the addition of some pretty awesome folks to the team, Uruut was born.

			%h3 Our Mission
			%h2 Help municipal & community projects get funded.
			%p While things have evolved since the first conversations, our mission to help fund communities remains the same. While none of us are ultra high net worth, that's ok, we don't have to be. Uruut is all about bringing individuals and multiple groups together to accomplish the same goal.
