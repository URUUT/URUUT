    %h2 Our Story

    %p Since 2000, TechBridge has delivered technology and business expertise to nonprofits in order to drive community impact. TechBridge fundraises so that nonprofits pay less for these important services. However, some nonprofits cannot afford even these below-market rates.

    %p In order help more nonprofits get the technology tools they need to be more effective, TechBridge created the Nonprofit Exchange. It’s a simple model: Nonprofits can post tech projects they need funding for and funders (whether individuals, companies or foundations) can select projects to which they want to contribute. TechBridge works with your nonprofit to scope your project, figure out the cost and give it the TechBridge Seal of Approval.

    %p We have partnered with the Atlanta startup URUUT to create this new crowd-funding platform. We appreciate their partnership and their commitment to improving communities one project at a time.
