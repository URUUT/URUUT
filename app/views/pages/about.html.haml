    %h2 Our Story

    %p The seed for Uruut was planted over 10 years ago. Two life long friends heard reports Mayor Bloomberg may have stepped in to fund key municipal and community projects in New York City. These were projects critical to NYC, but, unfortunately, they were falling off the city budget.

    %p From that day forward, these two friends sought a way to accomplish the same goal in communities across America, in spite of either one of them having pockets like Mr. Bloomberg.  Ten years after their first conversation, the pair encountered many twists and turns and met some pretty awesome folks who also embraced their vision.  In 2012, Uruut was born.
