      %h2 Company Background
      %p
        Uruut (pronounced You Root) started when two lifelong friends 
        set out to create a more streamlined, robust fundraising platform 
        to help local community projects raise more money. The initial 
        fundraising product was developed following ten years of 
        analyzing the charitable giving space, giving models and online 
        giving. What Uruut ultimately delivered was a best practices 
        fundraising platform combining best of class thinking across 
        charitable giving, technology, social interaction, analytics and 
        donor psychology.
      %p
        Shortly after delivering Uruut's fundraising product it became
        apparent there was more work to do to deliver best of class and
        cost sensible products across not only fundraising, but multiple
        disciplines across the entire nonproﬁt landscape. The current set
        of solutions are often classiﬁed as outdated, not ﬂexible or just
        too expensive.
