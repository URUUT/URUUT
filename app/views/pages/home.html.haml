    %h3 ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY
    %h2 Other crowdfunding platforms essentially say, “OK, the project is funded. Our job is done.”
    .float-left
      = image_tag "laptop.jpg"
    .marketing.float-left
      %p This is a foreign sentiment to us. While others disengage after a project has been funded, for Uruut, getting a project funded is just the beginning. We regard accountability and transparency as an absolute necessity, because you should know exactly how your resources are being applied, and that promises are being kept.  You should be connected to the lives your donations touch, so we’ve built a robust application that democratizes the funding process by providing insight into post-funding budget and project status.
