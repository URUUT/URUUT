			%h3 ANOTHER BIG DIFFERENCE
			%h2 Accountability & Transparency.
			%p Other crowdfunding platforms don't think its important to show how funds are spent once a project funds. URUUT doesn't only think its important, we view it as an absolute necessity. As such we've built a robust transparency & accountability platform providing insight into post-funding budget and project status.
