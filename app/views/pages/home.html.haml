		%h3 ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY
		%h2 Other crowdfunding platforms essentially say, “OK, the project is funded. Our job is done.”
		.float-left
			= image_tag "laptop.jpg"
		.marketing.float-left 
			%p This is a foreign sentiment to us. While others disengage after a project has been funded, for Uruut getting a project funded is just the beginning. We regard accountability and transparency as an absolute necessity, because you should know exactly how your resources are being spent, and that promises are being kept. So we’ve built a robust application to provide insight into post-funding budget and project status.
